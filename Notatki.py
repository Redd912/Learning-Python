# integer e.g. 1,3,4,5  = int
# real number e.g. 1.4, 54.22, 9493,34555 = float
# string e.g. "Hello World" = str
# boolean = True(1)/False(0) = bool (upper case mandatory)
# to find out what type of an expression you're dealing with, use type(), e.g. type(-12), type(3.14), type("hello world")
# use sys.float_info to find out about the specifics of floats for your runtime environment (smallest/largest number that can be represented with them)
# to convert an integer into a float, use float(), use type(float(2)) to convert and also check its type
# type(6/2) = float division, type(6//2) = result is rounded down to nearest integer (loss of data)
# float 3.99 won't be rounded up if converted into an integer, the result will be: 3
# Variables or constants (numbers) are called operands, and math symbols are called operators
# Tuples are an ordered sequence written as comma-separated elements within parentheses e.g. Ratings = (1,2,3,4,5)
# Another example: tuple1 = ("disco",10,1.2), if we type tuple1[0]: "disco, duple1[2]: 1.2
# First element in a list using index = L[0], but LAST = L[-1]
# Dictionaries use curly brackets {}, and have keys instead of indices and values instead of elements. The *key* difference is that the keys don't have to be integers
# Sets are a type of collection like lists, tuples, but unlike them, sets are unordered (no record of element position), furthermore, they act like sets in mathematics, they can have intersections and unions
# = is used for assignment (e.g. A = (1,2,3,4,5), whereas == is used for comparison (to check if A & B are equal, try print(sum(A)), print(sum(B)), != means "not equal to"
# Logic operators take boolean values and produce different boolean values e.g. turning True using not(True) into False, False into True using not(False) - other logics include also be OR & AND
# new statement under "if" will only be executed if there's an indent and the statements are true, otherwise the tasks will end
# else is used if none of the conitions are true before this else statement, else has no condition unlike if (e.g. if age > 18)
# Branching is basically that whole "if A = B do X, else Y"
